# **About Me**

Hi I am  ** Anderson Monge ** ðŸ‘‹,<br>
I am a current undergraduate student at the University of Houston majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science. I am pursuing an interest to be a Machine learning engineer/Data scientist and aid in the development of integrating the world of smart machines and data into everyday life. Besides that I also really love sports (soccer, basketball, and football) but I am a soccer player at heart.
