# **About Me**
<br>

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
As a creative researcher, I dream of a world where every individual can benefit from and also help the growth of novel technologies regardless of professionalism. Specifically, I am passionate about synergizing diverse <u>AI</u> technologies with <u>Human</u> capabilities to unlock their full potential and mitigate shortcomings. 
Current focus lies on efficiently extracting visual cognitive insights from humans and utilizing them to prevent model bias.
